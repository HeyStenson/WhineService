WHINE SERVICE:

Got a gripe? Have some grapes! Or, to put it more succinctly: Have some wine with that whine. 

A silly toy app that let me play with Angular.

Run http-server in the command line to start the app up locally, then go to either of the addresses it gives you.

Dependencies: Angular, Angular Animate, Angular Resource, Animate.css, and Bootstrap.
